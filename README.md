# [About Me][me] #
You [probably just want to take a look at my work][Repositories], [but][] [let](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/let-the-smoke-out.html) [me][me] [give][here] you [some context first][here].

[These days][], [I][me] [am actively seeking to join an exciting team to help solve real world problems][hire]. [I][me] [got into DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps), [and][] [computer science][] [in general][generalization], because [I][me] [love that once a problem is solved, its solution can be saved to allow for continuous progress and development][why computer science]. [A particular passion of mine is bringing security solutions to everyday development][chroot]. [While I consider myself  a developer-gone-sysadmin first (think site-reliability engineer)][SRE], [I][me] like to approach [my][me] [work from the mindset of a security penetration tester][blue-team]. [I][me] [treat security like a first-class citizen, opting to assume][chroot] [my][me] [code][Repositories] [will be used in a hostile environment][chroot]. [You can trust me to always proactively approach a problem with security in mind][blue-team] [and][] [automation in view][Sod's Law].

[I][me] am ...
 - self-motivated [and][] [continually seek to learn new skills][pulse].
 - [enthusiastic about defensive security][defensive security].
 - an analytical, [and][] often [divergent-thinker][], [but][] [with a laser like focus on my current problem][hire].
 - [a skeptic of technology who believes in][Sod's Law] [Murphy's Law][] [and][] [test-driven development][test-driven].
 - [a curious][google] [and][] [questioning learner who loves a variety of defendable perspectives to fuel my problem solving skills][ted].
 - [often curious about things beyond the scope of my role in order to better understand the context][status page] [of my solutions][Repositories].
 - [only human][layer 8].

[I][me] attained [my][me] B.S. in [computer science][] back in 2013.
[Some](https://www.wordnik.com/words/some) [`highlights` from my skill set are][hire]:

## Security is my passion. ##
_Given the slightest provocation [I][me] am known to go on evangelical tangents about security._

 - [Smart cards][smart cards]
 - [Network Security Appliances](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Network+Security+Appliances)
 - Anti-network Reconnaissance.

[![Shell Scripting](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shell-Scripting-blue.svg)][bash]
 - [Automation is my friend.][test-driven]
 - [I have experience developing portable POSIX and FHS compliant scripts][bash] [for a variety of tasks][tasks].
 - `While` [I][me] [can probably still churn out a bash script][bash] _faster_ [I][me] _prefer_ the [more][less] [readable][PEP20] [and][] [maintainable][] [python scripts][python] [these days][].

[![Programming](https://img.shields.io/badge/Programming--green.svg)](https://www.github.com/reactive-firewall/python-repo)
 - [![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-orange.svg)](https://www.github.com/reactive-firewall/java-repo)
 - Objective-C and C++ to name a few.
