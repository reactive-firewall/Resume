# About Me

You may be interested in reviewing my work, but let me provide some context first. I was initially drawn to Computer Science because I relish the idea that once a problem is solved, its solution can be reduced to code, enabling ongoing progress and development. Think of me as a developer-turned-sysadmin—or perhaps more accurately, a site reliability engineer with the heart of an explorer.

I approach my work from a security mindset. Security isn't merely a protocol to follow; it's the very atmosphere in which my code exists. I treat it like a first-class citizen, assuming my creations will operate in vulnerable environments. You can trust me to proactively tackle problems with security in mind and automation in view.

Failure, to me, is not a black hole to avoid but a nebula where new stars are born. External factors may make "failure" inevitable, but it's our reaction that truly defines us. I respond to setbacks by learning from them, as they've taught me more than success ever has. Each challenge enhances my journey, making it a perpetual learning experience.

## In Summation

**Code is my poetry.**

_I love learning, writing, and reading code. I find joy in the elegance of algorithms and the artistry of clean, efficient programming._

**Security is my passion.**

_Given the slightest provocation, I'm known to embark on enthusiastic discussions about security and client privacy—values that are paramount to me._

**Automation is my zen.**

_I believe the key to a happy and efficient team is automation. It streamlines processes and frees us to focus on innovation._
